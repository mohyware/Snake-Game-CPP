 # Snake Game
## Overview
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows by eating apples. The objective is to increase the snake's length without colliding with its own body or the game boundaries. This implementation expands upon the classic concept with multiplayer, fire-based combat, and wall destruction.

## Features :
1. Multiple Snakes: The game supports 1 or 2 snakes, each starting in different locations on the board.

2. Interactive Menu: The game menu includes engaging sound effects to enhance the player experience.

3. Limited Firepower: Players have a limited number of fires, which can be replenished by eating apples.

4. Scoreboard: A dynamic scoreboard displays the number of fires each player currently has, positioned beneath the game screen.

5. Unique Apple Generators: Each side of the game board has its own apple generator, providing a unique gameplay experience.

6. Wall Damage: Fires can damage walls, breaking them down one block at a time.

7. Player Combat: Snakes can attack and kill each other using fire. The game displays a unique victory message for the winning snake.

8. Loss Conditions: A snake loses the game if it:

- Touches the other snake's body.
- Collides with its own body.
- Hits a wall.
